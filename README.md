# Using the Calculator Application

* In the browser's URL bar, type: `https://localhost:8083/calculator-app/calculator`.
* To perform an operation type in the browser's URL bar: `https://localhost:8083/calculator-app/calculator?val1=[value to calculate]&val2=[value to calculate]&operation=[desired operation (uppercase)]`.
* Here is one example: `https://localhost:8083/calculator-app/calculator?val1=5&val2=3&operation=MULT`.
* Operations supported by the calculator: `SUM(+), SUB(-), DIV(/), MULT(*) and POW(^)`.
* You can do as many operations as you want and then check the history of operations performed.
* To check the history, in the browser's URL bar, type `https://localhost:8083/calculator-app/calculator?showhistory`.

**_That's all! I hope you enjoy my Calculator Application. See ya!_**
